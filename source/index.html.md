# Welcome
Yay, you made it! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the documentation for UCL's brand new open API. Each service is listed below with examples in three different programming languages (Shell script using cURL, Python and JavaScript) to help you get going as quickly as possible.

The API will be made up of several services, each of which will be separately versioned and explained. Every service will be documented here with important information, tips and examples.

## Get Your API Key
Before you can use the API you should head to the [API Dashboard](https://uclapi.com/dashboard) and sign up using your UCL user account. Once logged into the dashboard simply name your app and you'll be given a key that you can use to access all the services. Simples!

## API Rate Limits

Rate limiting of the API is primarily on a per-user basis. The limit is calculated against user's ID (e-mail) across all access tokens.

The limit is 10 000 requests per day and resets every day midnight London time. (00:00 GMT)

When a request is throttled, the response returned by the server has HTTP Status Code "429 Too Many Requests". It includes a `Retry-After` header with the number of seconds the client is throttled for.

If you would like your rate limit to be increased, contact us at isd.apiteam@ucl.ac.uk

# Version Information

Each service has a header named `uclapi-servicenamehere-version` which you can add to your requests, where `servicenamehere` is the endpoint name for the service you are using. For example, for the Room Bookings service you would set the `uclapi-roombookings-version` header.

```shell
curl -H "uclapi-roombookings-version: 1" https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb
```

```python
import requests

params = {
  "token": "uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb"
}
headers = {
  "uclapi-roombookings-version": "1"
}
r = requests.get("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms", params=params, headers=headers)
print(r.json())
```

```javascript
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("uclapi-roombookings-version", "1");
var initData = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: myHeaders,
  mode: 'cors',
  cache: 'default'
};
fetch("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb", initData)
.then((response) => {
  return response.json()
})
.then((json) => {
  console.log(json);
  })
```

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Really Important Warning</strong>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>By default, every UCL API request gets sent to the <strong>latest version</strong> of the service you requested.</li>
    <li>This is okay for test purposes.</li>
    <li>If you are deploying into production you must follow the versioning instructions to ensure you are not affected by breaking changes.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

On the right hand side you'll see a code sample with the version data added. We are specifying that version `1` of the `roombookings` service should be used for the request URL `https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb`. You should amend the example accordingly for the service and API version you are using.

# OAuth

This is a quick guide to OAuth support in UCL API for developers. OAuth is a protocol that lets external apps request secure access to private UCL account data without getting your password. This can be done with a "Sign In With UCL" button on your website which avoids UCL users from needing to set up another account username and password. It also allows you as a developer to, for example, get a user's personal timetable.

Sounds intriguing? Demo of "Sign In With UCL" is located [here](https://uclapi-oauth-demo.glitch.me).

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/uclapi-oauth-demo)

## Sign In With UCL Button

If you want to add a "Sign In With UCL" button to your website, which looks like this:

![](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uclapi-static/SignInWithUCLSmall.png)

you can copy the following the following code:

```plaintext
<a href="https://uclapi.com/oauth/authorise?client_id=CLIENT_ID&state=STATE">
<img src="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uclapi-static/SignInWithUCLSmall.png">
</a>
```

where `CLIENT_ID` and `STATE` should be replaced by `client_id` of your app and a random `state`.

## Scopes

OAuth scopes specify how your app needs to access a UCL user's account. As an app developer, you set the desired scopes in the [API Dashboard](https://uclapi.com/dashboard). When a user is responding to your authorisation request, the requested scopes will be displayed to the user.

## OAuth Workflow

If your application wants to use OAuth, you **must** set a callback URL in the dashboard. Then the app should follow this procedure:

1. Send a request to `https://uclapi.com/oauth/authorise` with `state` and the application's `client_id`.

2. The user will need to log in with their UCL credentials on the UCL Single Sign-on website (if not logged in already).

3. The user will be allowed to either authorise or deny the application, based on the OAuth scope requested. If the application is authorised, the callback URL receives `client_id`, `state` (specified in 1.), `result`, and `code`.

If the application is denied, the callback URL receives `result` and `state`, and no private data will be provided to the application.

4. To receive the OAuth user token (for performing actions on user's behalf), we require `code` (from 3.), `client_id`, and `client_secret`. These should then be set to `https://uclapi.com/oauth/token`, which will return a response containing `state`, `ok`, `client_id`, `token` (OAuth user token), and `scope` (scopes the app can access on the user's behalf).

### Paginated Request
**Endpoint:** `https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings`

Paginated requests also go to the `/bookings` endpoint but, unlike the regular requests, only the `token` and `page_token` should be supplied. All other filters are "remembered" from the initiating regular request.

The API "remembers" how many requests you've made, so to move through the pages you can keep making the same request (with the same `token` and `page_token`) until the response's `next_page_exists` field is `false`.

**Allowed request type:** `GET`

#### Query Parameters

```shell
curl https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&page_token=6hb14hXjRV

  "page_token": "6hb14hXjRV"
}

r = requests.get("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings", params=params)
print(r.json())
```

    "ok": true,
    "page_token": "wmCUiJgItq",
    "next_page_exists": true,
    "bookings": [
      {
        "roomname": "Christopher Ingold Building XLG2 Auditorium",

This endpoint returns any equipment/feature information about a specific room. So, for example whether there is a `Whiteboard` or a `DVD Player` in the room. A full example can be seen [here.](https://roombooking.ucl.ac.uk/rb/bookableSpace/roomInfo.html?room=B15B&building=016&invoker=EFD)

You _need_ to supply a `token`, `roomid`, and `siteid` to get a response.

**Allowed request type:** `GET`

### Query Parameters

```shell
curl https://uclapi.com/roombookings/equipment?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&roomid=433&siteid=086
```

```python
import requests

params = {
  "token": "uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb",
  "roomid": "433"
  "siteid": "086"
}

r = requests.get("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/equipment", params=params)
print(r.json())
```

```javascript
fetch("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/equipment?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&roomid=433&siteid=086")
.then((response) => {
  return response.json()
})
.then((json) => {
  console.log(json);
  })
```

Parameter | Example | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -------- | -----------
`token` | `uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb` | Required | Authentication token
`roomid` | `433` | Required | The room ID (not to be confused with the `roomname`)
`siteid` | `086`| Required | Every room is inside a site (building). All sites have IDs.

### Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "equipment": [
    {
      "type": "FF",
      "description": "Managed PC",
      "units": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "FE",
      "description": "Chairs with Tables",
      "units": 1
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
The equipment field contains a list of equipment items. This list can have a different length depending on the room, and it can also be empty.

Each equipment item contains a `type`, a `description`, and the number of `units`.

Equipment Item | Example      |  Description
-------------- | ------------ |  -----------
`type`         | `FE`         | The type of equipment. Either Fixed Equipment (`FE`) or Fixed Feature (`FF`).
`description`  | `Managed PC` | What the piece of equipment actually is.
`units`        | `1`          | The number of times this piece of equipment exists in the room.

### Errors

Error                 | Description
----------------------| -----------
`No token provided`   | Gets returned when you have not supplied a `token` in your request.
`Token does not exist`| Gets returned when you supply an invalid `token`.
`No roomid supplied`  | Gets returned when you don't supply a `roomid`.
`No siteid supplied`  | Gets returned when you don't supply a `siteid`.


## Webhooks
With webhooks, you don't send HTTP requests to us, *we* send HTTP requests to you.
This is useful for data that changes frequently, such as room bookings. Whenever a booking gets added or removed, we'll send those details to your server.

### Setup
After creating an app in the [dashboard](https://uclapi.com/dashboard/), you can configure webhook settings in the app settings view.


Setting | Example              |  Description
-------------- | ----------------- |  -----------
Verification Secret         | `bc35f27d47742f7-c3bd7768defb2c2-1c556d86859419a-897b8dc9273691a`         | Random string that you use to make sure that all requests to your webhook URL come from UCL API servers, and not a third party. You must keep this secret.
Webhook URL  | `https://example.com/webhook` | The URL must use https and must be a publicly accessible URL. This is the URL we'll send events to.
`siteid`        | `086`          | (Optional) In case you want to restrict the booking events you receive to only one specific `siteid`.
`roomid`        | `433`          | (Optional) In case you want to restrict the booking events you receive to only one specific `roomid`.
`contact`        | `Michael Arthur`          | (Optional) In case you want to restrict the booking events you receive to only one specific `contact`.


### Events
Whenever you receive data on your webhook we call that an "event". At the moment there are 2 events: `challenge` and `bookings_changed`

Events are always delivered as POST requests to your webhook URL. The data will be JSON inside the body of the POST request. Every event will contain at least 3 components: `service`, `name`, `verification_secret`. You can see an example on the right.  
A full-fledged example app that makes use of UCL API webhooks (written in Python) can be found [here.](https://github.com/uclapi/webhook_demo_app)

```json
{
  "service": "webhooks",
  "name": "challenge",
  "verification_secret": "bc35f27d47742f7-c3bd7768defb2c2-1c556d86859419a-897b8dc9273691a",
  ...
}
```

### challenge event
You'll receive this event when you first input or alter your webhook URL. It exists to make sure that the URL you entered is under your control.
The JSON data sent to you contains a `challenge` parameter. You need to set up your code to respond promptly with a JSON object containing only the challenge parameter.

> Request from UCL API to your endpoint

```json
{
  "service": "webhooks",
  "name": "challenge",
  "verification_secret": "bc35f27d47742f7-c3bd7768defb2c2-1c556d86859419a-897b8dc9273691a",
  "challenge": "f9b4fd5325e21e3-002e9e00a1b1af6-bc37b346d59b0cb-730043261cfa206"
}
```


> Prompt response from your server to verify URL control

```json
{
  "challenge": "f9b4fd5325e21e3-002e9e00a1b1af6-bc37b346d59b0cb-730043261cfa206"
}
```

### bookings_changed event
You'll receive this event when a booking was either added or removed. You can see an example on the right.  
A `bookings_changed` event contains at least either one `bookings_added` or `bookings_removed` key, but not necessarily both.

```json
{
  "service": "roombookings",
  "name": "bookings_changed",
  "verification_secret": "bc35f27d47742f7-c3bd7768defb2c2-1c556d86859419a-897b8dc9273691a",
